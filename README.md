# Workstation Provision and Configure Scripts

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is provide a central area to store scripts that are used to provision and configure workstations that I use. By moving the workstation setup out of my head and into these scripts I will be able to move from machine to machine quicker and replace machines with less pain and effort on my part. I have working systems across quite a few machines and manually managing them has become difficult and wastes quite a bit of time.

## Usage
To use the scripts in this project you will need to have installed git and then download this project and run the setup.sh for *nix systems or setup.cmd for windows systems.

## Notes
I have just started this project so it is not really useful at the moment.
